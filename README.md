# DataVis_altair
Here are two projects that I did during my master studies in Data Science. They are about data visualization in Python with altair library. The datasets used are about Taylor Swift and other pop artists.



Project 1:
In directory project1.
We want to see how the evolution of Taylor Swift’s songs has been along the years.
Create a set of views using Python and Vega-Altair that answer to a few questions that can be seen in the notebook

Project 2:
In directory project2.
We have information about some of the most relevant music pop artists. Analyze (and augment the dataset if necessary) to perform the current project.
• What artists have been more successful along the whole time?
• What artists have been more successful on a concrete year?
• How does the artists’ careers compare from their first album release?
• Compare how the concerts have performed for a subset of artists (need to augment data).
• Compare the concert attendance (or income, or place, or other variables) of a subset of artists (the user can select among) along time.


The work is done notebooks. The plots of altair library are not shown in github. They have to run. I have some images of the final multi-views.
