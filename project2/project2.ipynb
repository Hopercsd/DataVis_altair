Firstly, I included the resolve_scale color independent, so I made sure that each chart retains its initial palette given, which I did not do in the previous deliverable. Also I had an issue in the word cloud with the strokeWidth being 0, which is the variable to take out the borders of the chart. This parameter it was given in the creation of the chart, but in the hconcat/vconcat could not be read and it was returning errors. I had to adjust it in the multi-view here. The most challenging problem I had to solve was the size of the word cloud and the map, where when put togheter their sizes was extremely big and a bit distorted. This was solved by adding the size='independent' in the resolve_scale.
